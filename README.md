# Low Level Design (LLD) Repository in Java üöÄ

Welcome to the **Low Level Design Repository**!  
This repository contains Java implementations of core **Design Patterns** and real-world **LLD Problems** commonly asked in system design interviews at top tech companies.

---

## üìÅ Structure

- `design.patterns`: Core design patterns grouped under **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** categories.
- `design.problems`: End-to-end implementation of real-world system design problems using OOP principles and patterns.
